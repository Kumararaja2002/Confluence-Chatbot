# Confluence-Chatbot
Confluence Q&amp;A Chatbot is an intelligent assistant built using LangChain, Groq's LLaMA  model, and FAISS, designed to help users interact with Confluence documentation through natural language queries. This project is ideal for teams that use Confluence for documentation and want to improve accessibility and productivity by conversational search.
